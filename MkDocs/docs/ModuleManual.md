# Flowmodel Module Manual
???+ info "Missing content"
    It was initially planned to write an manual for the flowmodel module. With limited time I was unable to finish this manual in time, and since it was not obligatory it skipped for the time being. It might be updated in the week until the presentation, but since it is not part of the assignment there is no obligation to evaluate it unless one wants to.
