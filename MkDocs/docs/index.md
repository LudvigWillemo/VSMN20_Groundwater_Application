This documentation website composes the final hand-in for the course Software Development for Technical Applications (VSMN20) at Lund University. This page contains a brief theoretical introduction to groundwater flow, details on the program structure, manuals for both the application and the module. Each part has its own page, which can be reached by using the top navigation tab. A git repository containing the latest program version is available [here](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ).

### Acknowledgements
The website is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with a theme and additional functionality from [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). For the source code documentation, the plugin [mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/) was used. The application UI was inspired by multiple QtDesigner tutorials made by [Wanderson](https://www.youtube.com/c/WandersonIsMe) on YouTube.

???+ bug "Possible bug"
    During the final revision of the program, a bug appeared on some machines that prevents figures to be properly shown in the figure tab. While I think it is fixed, I cannot be sure since it only did not affect all machines. Consult the manual to see how it is supposed to look. I was not able to find a fix yet, but I am working on it and will update this box if it is fixed.
